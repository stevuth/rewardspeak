 * @file Firestore Security Rules
 * @core philosophy This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * ensuring that only authenticated users can access their own data.
 * @data structure All user data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path, where `{userId}`
 * corresponds to the Firebase Auth UID.
 * @key security decisions Listing all users is disallowed. Write access is restricted to the
 * authenticated user matching the `userId` in the path.
 * @denormalization None.
 * @structural segregation None.
