/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Rewards Peak.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and withdrawals,
 * while allowing public read access to offers and leaderboards.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profiles, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /offers: Stores available offers, publicly readable.
 * - /leaderboard: Stores leaderboard entries, publicly readable.
 * - /users/{userId}/withdrawals: Stores user withdrawal history, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /users/{userId}/activity: Stores offers a user has interacted with, accessible only to the owner.
 * - /offer-walls: Stores offer walls, publicly readable.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only create, update, and delete their own profiles and withdrawal requests.
 * - Offers, offer walls and leaderboards are publicly readable but not writable via the client.
 * - Listing of withdrawals is restricted to the owner.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The `Withdrawal` entity contains a `userId` field, which is used to enforce ownership.
 * - The `User` entity's `id` field is the same as the `userId` in the path, allowing for path-based authorization.
